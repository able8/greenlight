## Introduction

In this book we’re going to work through the start-to-finish build of an application called Greenlight — a JSON API for retrieving and managing information about movies. You can think of the core functionality as being a 
bit like the Open Movie Database API.

## Chapter 2.1 Project Setup and Skeleton Structure

```bash
mkdir greenlight
go mod init github.com/able8/greenlight

mkdir -p bin cmd/api internal migrations remote
touch Makefile
touch cmd/api/main.go

go run ./cmd/api  
```

## Chapter 2.2 Basic HTTP Server

```bsh
go run ./cmd/api  

curl -i localhost:4000/v1/healthcheck

go run ./cmd/api  -port=3000 -env=production
```

http://localhost:4000/v1/healthcheck


## 2.3. API Endpoints and RESTful Routing

- Choosing a router

```bash
go get github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter@v1.3.0
```

```bash
curl -i localhost:4000/v1/healthcheck

curl -X POST localhost:4000/v1/movies

curl localhost:4000/v1/movies/123
```
