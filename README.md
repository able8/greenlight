## Introduction

In this book we’re going to work through the start-to-finish build of an application called Greenlight — a JSON API for retrieving and managing information about movies. You can think of the core functionality as being a 
bit like the Open Movie Database API.

## Chapter 2.1 Project Setup and Skeleton Structure

```bash
mkdir greenlight
go mod init github.com/able8/greenlight

mkdir -p bin cmd/api internal migrations remote
touch Makefile
touch cmd/api/main.go

go run ./cmd/api  
```
